# Decentralized Task Manager

## Description
My goal for this project is to make a program to manage your todo list, calendar, and quick notes that can be synced between all of your devices without using a 3rd party cloud provider (or any cloud provider!). To do this I am utilizing the java script library Gun.js to use a peer to peer network to sync the data.
